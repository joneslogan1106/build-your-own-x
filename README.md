# Build my own X

Currently to review these programming languages, I will be focusing on learning them or getting a deeper understanding, lol its going to be a while before I start on [[X.md]].
In this repo, I will go through everything in X.md to expand my programming knowledge, Also in this repo I will have my programming to learn these programming languages or understand them at a lower-level(NOTE: I do already know some programming languages I'm just learning them at a deeper level, For example python).
